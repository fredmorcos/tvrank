# Changes in `0.9.0`:

* Dependency version updates.
* Remove the `enum-utils` and `failure` crates as dependencies. The `failure` crate was a
  dependency of `enum-utils` and has a security vulnerability which will not be fixed and
  the crate is deprecated anyway. The `enum-utils` crate wasn't used much so it was
  replaced with custom code.
* Update to clap version 4 for the parsing command-line arguments.
* Switch from `OpenSSL` to `rusTLS`. The former was causing linking problems on modern
  Ubuntu systems.
* Minor code and documentation cleanups and modernization.
